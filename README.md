Gleipnir is a python toolkit that provides an easy to use interface for Bayesian parameter inference and model selection using Nested Sampling. It has a built-in implementation of the classic Nested Sampling algorithm but also provides a common interface to the Nested Sampling implementations MultiNest, PolyChord, and DNest4.
Although Gleipnir provides a general framework for running Nested Sampling simulations, it was created with biological models in mind. It therefore supplies additional tools for working with biological models in the PySB format (see the PySB Utilities section). Likewise, Gleipnir's API was designed to be familiar to users of [PyDREAM](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/PyDREAM) and [SimplePSO](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/ParticleSwarmOptimization), which are primarily used for biological model calibration.

### What is Nested Sampling?

Nested Sampling is a numerical integration scheme for estimating the marginal likelihood, or in Nested Sampling parlance, the 'evidence' of high-dimensional models
As a side-effect of the evidence calculation, estimates of the posterior probability distributions of model parameters can also be generated.   

In particular, Nested Sampling was
designed to handle evaluae the evidence of high-dimensional models where the likelihood is exponentially localized in the prior probability mass. In the Nested Sampling approach, the evidence is first converted from a (possibly) multi-dimensional integral into a one-dimensional integral taken over a mapping of the likelihood function to elements of the unit prior probability mass (X). In principle, this is achieved by using a top-down
approach in which sample points are drawn according to the prior distribution, and the unit prior probability is subdivided
into equal fractional elements from X = 1 down to X = 0 and
mapped to the likelihood function, L(X), via a likelihood sorting routine.

The Nested Sampling method was originally developed by John Skilling; see the following references:

# PySB Utilities

## nestedsample_it
nestedsample_it is a utility that helps generate a Nested Sampling run script or NestedSampling objects for a PySB model.

### Commmand line use
nestedsample_it can be used as a command line utility to generate a template Nested Sampling run script for a PySB model. nestedsample_it reads the model file, imports and pulls out all the kinetic parameters, and then writes out a run_NS script for that model. nestedsample_it currently writes out a run script for classic Nested Sampling via Gleipnir, so you'll need to modify it to use one of the other Nested Samplers (MultiNest, PolyChord, or DNest4). And you will need to edit the run script to load any data and modify the loglikelihood function, but nestedsample_it should give you a good starting point.

Run nestedsample_it from the command line with following format:
```
python -m glepnir.pysb_utilities.nestedsample_it model.py output_path
```      
where output_path is the directory/folder location where you want the generated script
to be saved.

The command line version of nestedsample_it also has support for a limited set of #NESTEDSAMPLE_IT directives which can be added to model files. The current directives are:
  * #NESTEDSAMPLE_IT prior [param_name, param_index] [norm, uniform]  
    * Specify the type of prior to assign to a parameter. The parameter can either be specified by its name or its index (in model.parameters). The priors that can be assigned are either norm or uniform; note that uniform is the default for all parameters.  
  * #NESTEDSAMPLE_IT no-sample [param_name, param_index]
     * Specify a fixed parameter (i.e., not to included in sampling). The parameter can either be specified by its name or its index (in model.parameters).          


### Progammatic use via the NestedSampleIt class
The nestedsample_it utility can be used progammatically via the NestedSampleIt
class. It's importable from the pysb_utilities module:
```python
from gleipnir.pysb_utilities import NestedSampleIt
```
The NestedSampleIt class can build an instance of a NestedSampling object.  
 Here's a faux minimal example:
```python
from my_pysb_model import model as my_model
from gleipnir.pysb_utilities import NestedSampleIt
import numpy as np

timespan = np.linspace(0., 10., 10)
data = np.load('my_data.npy')
data_sd = np.load('my_data_sd.npy')
observable_data = dict()
time_idxs = list(range(len(timespan)))
observable_data['my_observable'] = (data, data_sd, time_idxs)
# Initialize the NestedSampleIt instance with the model details.
sample_it = NestedSampleIt(my_model, observable_data, timespan)
# Now build the NestedSampling object. -- All inputs are
# optional keyword arguments.
nested_sampler = sample_it(ns_version='gleipnir-classic',
                           ns_population_size=100,
                           ns_kwargs=dict(),
                           log_likelihood_type='logpdf')
# Then you can run the nested sampler.
log_evidence, log_evidence_error = nested_sampler.run()
```

NestedSampleIt constructs the NestedSampling object to sample all of a model's kinetic rate parameters. It assumes that the priors are uniform with size 4 orders of magnitude and centered on the values defined in the model.

In addition, NestedSampleIt crrently has three pre-defined loglikelihood functions with different estimators. They can be specified with the keyword parameter log_likelihood_type:
```python
# Now build the NestedSampling object.
nested_sampler = sample_it(log_likelihood_type='logpdf')
```
The options are
  * 'logpdf'=>Compute the loglikelihood using the
normal distribution estimator
  * 'mse'=>Compute the loglikelihood using the
negative mean squared error estimator
  * 'sse'=>Compute the loglikelihood using
the negative sum of squared errors estimator.
The default is 'logpdf'.
Each of these functions computes the loglikelihood estimate using the timecourse output of a model simulation for each observable defined in the `observable_data` dictionary.
If you want to use a different or more complicated likelihood function with NestedSampleIt then you'll need to subclass it and override one of the existing loglikelihood functions.  

#### NestIt
The nestedsample_it module has a built-in helper class, NestIt, which can be used in conjunction of with NestedSampleIt class. NestIt can be used at the level of PySB model definition to log which parameters to include in
a Nested Sampling run. It can be imported from the pysb_utilities module:
```python
from gleipnir.pysb_utilities import NestIt
```
It is passed at instantiation to the NestedSampleIt class, which uses it
to build the sampled parameters list and parameter mask for the likelihood
function.
See the following example files:

   * [dimerization_model_nestit](./examples/pysb_dimerization_model/dimerization_model_nestit.py) - example model definition using NestIt to flag parameters.
   * [run_NS_NestedSampleIt_NestIt_dimerization_model](./examples/pysb_dimerization_model/run_NS_NestedSampleIt_NestIt_dimerization_model.py) - example use of NestIt with NestedSampleIt.

Note that if you flag a parameter for sampling without setting a prior, NestIt will by default assign the parameter a uniform prior centered on the parameter's value with a width of 4 orders of magnitude.  

#### Builder class from pysb.builder

The Builder class from pysb.builder can also be used in conjunction with the NestedSampleIt class. The Builder class itself is a wrapper class that can be used to construct a PySB model and set parameter priors, logging them for sampling. Although
this feature was originally intended for use with the BayesSB package, the NestedSampleIt class supports it as a logger for sampled parameters.
The instance of the Builder is passed at instantiation to the NestedSampleIt class, which uses it to build the sampled parameters list and parameter mask for the likelihood function.
See the following example files:

   * [dimerization_model_builder](./examples/pysb_dimerization_model/dimerization_model_builder.py) - example model definition using Builder to construct a PySB model and flag parameters for sampling.
   * [run_NS_NestedSampleIt_Builder_dimerization_model](./examples/pysb_dimerization_model/run_NS_NestedSampleIt_Builder_dimerization_model.py) - example use of Builder with NestedSampleIt.

Note that you have to explicitly set a prior for each parameter that you want to sample when you add it your model with the builder.parameter function. If no
prior is given the parameter won't be included as a sampled parameter in the Nested Sampling run.

## HypSelector

HypSelector is a tool for hypothesis selection using [HypBuilder](https://github.com/LoLab-VU/HypBuilder) and Nested Sampling-based model selection. Models embodying different hypotheses (e.g., optional reactions) can be defined using the HypBuilder csv syntax. HypSelector then allows users to easily compare all the hypothetical model variants generated by HypBuilder by performing Nested Sampling to compute their evidences and thereby do model selection; HypSelector also provides functionality to estimate Bayes factors from the evidence estimates, as well as estimators for the Akaike, Bayesian, and Deviance information criteria computed from the Nested Sampling outputs. See the [grouped reactions example](./examples/HypSelector/grouped_reactions) or the [HypSelector Example Jupyter Notebook](./jupyter_notebooks/HypSelector_example.ipynb) to see example usage of HypSelector.

## ModelSelector

Similar to HypSelector, ModelSelector is a tool for PySB model selection using Nested Sampling-based model selection. ModelSelector allows users to easily compare model variants written in PySB and see which one may best explain a dataset by performing Nested Sampling to compute their evidences and thereby do model selection; ModelSelector also provides functionality to estimate Bayes factors from the evidence estimates, as well as estimators for the Akaike, Bayesian, and Deviance information criteria computed from the Nested Sampling outputs. See the [ModelSelector Example Jupyter Notebook](./jupyter_notebooks/ModelSelector_example.ipynb) to see example usage of ModelSelector.
